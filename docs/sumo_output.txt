SUMO can generate different output files:

1) floating car data (FCD) - positions of all vehicles at every simulation step
http://sumo.sourceforge.net/doc/current/docs/userdoc/Simulation/Output/FCDOutput.html

Calling from command line:
sumo -c scenario.sumocfg  --fcd-output "fcd.xml"

Output:
time_step	 (simulation) seconds	 The time step described by the values within this timestep-element
id	 id	 The id of the vehicle
type	 id	 The name of the vehicle type
speed	 m/s	 The speed of the vehicle
angle	 degree	 The angle of the vehicle
pos_x	 ---	 The absolut X coordinate of the vehicle. The value depends on the given geographic projection
pos_y	 ---	 The absolut Y coordinate of the vehicle. The value depends on the given geographic projection

2) probe data of a specific vehicle type - positions of selected vehicles types (or all) with the specified frequency
http://sumo.sourceforge.net/doc/current/docs/userdoc/Simulation/Output/VTypeProbe.html

Calling from an additional config file "additional.add.xml":
<additional>
    <vTypeProbe id="probe1" type="DEFAULT_VEHTYPE" freq="1" file="output.xml"/>
</additional>

timestep@time	 (simulation) seconds	 The time this information describes
timestep@id	 id	 The id of the detector
vtype	 id	 The id of the vehicle type observed by this detector
vehicle@id	 (vehicle) id	 The id of the described vehicle
lane	 (lane) id	 The id of the lane the vehicle was on.
pos	 m	 The position of the vehicle on lane
x	 m	 The x-position of the vehicle within the net
y	 m	 The y-position of the vehicle within the net
lat	 degrees*100,000	 The lat-position of the vehicle within the net
lon	 degrees*100,000	 The lon-position of the vehicle within the net
speed	 m/s	 The speed of the vehicle within the time step.

3) netstate - the total status of the simulation (edges and vehicles on edges at every simulation step)
http://sumo.sourceforge.net/doc/current/docs/userdoc/Simulation/Output/RawDump.html

Calling from config file:
<output> 
   <netstate-dump value="<FILE>" />
</output>

Output:
time	 (simulation) seconds	 The time step described by the values within this timestep-element
id	 id	 The id of the edge/lane/vehicle
pos	 m	 The position of the vehicle at the lane within the described time step
speed	 m/s	 The speed of the vehicle within the described time step

4) edge data - information about number of vehicles and their speed for all edges (for visualisation)

Calling in additional config file (aggregation of data every 15 minutes)
<additional>
   <edgeData id="edge_dump" file="edge_dump.xml" freq="900" />
</additional>
