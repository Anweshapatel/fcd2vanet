1. Generate FCD output from SUMO

Run SUMO simulation with your network and generate an output file you need.

We use floating car data (FCD) output by calling with an example SUMO scenario:

sumo -c sumo/Luxembourg/scenario.sumocfg --fcd-output fcd.xml

The scenario was tested with SUMO 0.17.1 (May 3rd, 2013 release) and consists of following files:
- scenario.sumocfg - a config file that sets input files, output files and the simulation time 
- additional.add.xml - an additional configuration file specifying vTypeProbe output files.
- Luxembourg.net.xml - network of Luxembourg country.
- Luxembourg.rou.xml - vehicular traces for Luxembourg country generated by VehiLux. Traces cover the whole country and half of a day from midnight till noon.

As an ouput you should get a floating car data (fcd) file: fcd.xml


You can chunk your original fcd.xml file to get a smaller fcd.xml file. 

To get FCD for a specified time period and a step size, run script

python /scripts/fcd_chunk.py -fcdFile data/Luxembourg/fcd.xml --chunkOutput data/Luxembourg/chunkFCD.xml --startTime 21630 --endTime 21640 --stepSize 1

! Be aware that in the begining of simulation the network is empty. If you want to evaluate network in of a 'normal' state, you should skip the time that SUMO needs for populating the network with vehicles.
